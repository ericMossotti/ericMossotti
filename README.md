My purpose here is to contribute towards an environment of understanding, skill progression and creative expression. 

- I’m currently working on a weather data API to better inform trucking industry participants of optimal contract prices.

- I’m currently applying my skills to all things data with applications to various scientific fields, subjects and more.
